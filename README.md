### Summary
---

Opted to upgrade all `package.json` dependancies to latest.

I also opted to reduced the amount of module files. For me it was just easier to consolidate everything to a basic _(singular)_ `app`, `controllers`, `directives`, `services` and `filters` files. 

Good read for old AngularJS... was bleeding edge in 2014. I moved all the API stuff into the main application to simplify the inner workings.
